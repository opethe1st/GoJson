# My implementation of the Json specification in Go

DONT USE IN PRODUCTION :D
I wrote this to practise Go.

What's left?
* Handle whitespace ✅
* Error handling
* Handle boolean and null literals ✅
* Handle number literals ✅
* Handle string escapes ✅
* Write the dump function - > (easy? how do we know the type of the object being pointed to?)
* Benchmark against the standard libraries implementation
* Study the standard libraries implementation
* Write about how I implemented the JSON spec in Go. Focus on what was difficult and what I learned.
